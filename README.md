# AI Study App Website

Simple static website that extracts text from PDF files and summarizes them in the browser using [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) and [@xenova/transformers](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js).

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser, choose a PDF file and click **Summarize** to generate a short summary of the document.

## Development

This project runs entirely in the browser, so no build step or server is required. The repository exists only for GitHub pull requests and to keep the code online.

## Testing

No automated tests are configured.
