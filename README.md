# AI Study Helper Website

Simple static site that extracts text from PDF files, summarizes the content and answers questions in the browser using [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) and [@xenova/transformers](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js).

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser and choose a PDF file. Click **Summarize** to generate a short overview, or type a question about the document and click **Ask** to receive an AI-generated answer.

## Development

This project runs entirely in the browser, so no build step or server is required. The repository exists only for GitHub pull requests and to keep the code online.

## Testing

No automated tests are configured.
